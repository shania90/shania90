// 01 ABOUT ME
#OnlineMarketingSpecialist #WebDesign #HTML #CSS #SaSS #Wordpress 

I have always had an interest in graphic design and online marketing, and going at Information Technology University was my opportunity to expand my knowledge and put my skills into practice.

I'm happy to say I made a great choice. I graduated graphic design and started job at marketing agency. I've had the privilige of working as Online Marketing Specialist. I learnt a lot about SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), SEM (Search Engine Marketing) and how to talk with clients.

In the meantime my career I was creating websites on HTML/CSS technology and CMS Wordpress. Now it's time to increase my ability. I would like to become Front End Developer that's why I'm learning programming language Java Script at this time.
